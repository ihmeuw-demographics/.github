# Contributing to `ihmeuw-demographics` repositories

The demographics team for the [Global Burden of Disease Study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd) at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/) is actively working on moving more code development to publicly available github repositories.

We encourage contributions of bug reports, feature requests, improved documentation, and software development. This can be in the form of creating a new Github issue, or making changes and submitting a pull request. Pull requests must be reviewed and approved by GBD demographics team members to ensure documentation, testing, code style, and other standards are met.

As this open source project is still in its infancy, documentation and testing has mainly been created and reviewed by GBD demographics team members, so we appreciate feedback in making this work more accessible to collaborators outside of IHME.

## Contributing to R packages

The main repositories included in `ihmeuw-demographics` so far are R packages that implement our commonly used utility functions and methods. Prior to contributing to these R packages, collaborators should be familiar with the basic R package structure and standards as described in the [`packageTemplate` wiki](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki#ihmeuw-demographics-r-package-development). We predominantly follow the guidelines outlined in the [R packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.

The [wiki](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki#ihmeuw-demographics-r-package-development) reviews key points from the book plus highlights our standards and style including:
* [function documentation standards](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki/Editing-documentation)
* [how to add tests](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki/Creating-tests)
* [code style guide](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki/Code-style-guide)
* [example workflow for adding new functions to the packages](https://github.com/ihmeuw-demographics/packageTemplate/wiki/Workflow-for-new-functions).
